# ðŸ“‚ Script Directory â€“ Statistical and Spatial Analysis

This folder contains R scripts used to reproduce the main statistical results presented in the manuscript:

**"Assessing Tourism Pressure on Wildlife in a Protected Area: A Social Big Data Approach Using Photo-Sharing Data and Species Distribution Modelling."**

Although the figures were prepared externally, the statistical procedures and data necessary to regenerate key results are documented here.
